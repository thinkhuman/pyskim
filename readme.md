#Pyskim

Uses Beautiful Soup 4 and requests module; you'll need to install both of these before using Pyskim.

Right now, Pyskim just:

1. Asks for a URL to scrape and an output file name
2. Scrapes the links from the URL you enter
3. Prints the links to the screen
4. Puts the links in an output file with the name you supplied.
